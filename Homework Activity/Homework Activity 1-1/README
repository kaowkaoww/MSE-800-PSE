# Activity â€“ Create a NumPy array of the first 10 positive integers
This activity demonstrates how to use NumPy to create and manipulate arrays.

## Description
In this exercise, I created a NumPy array with the following 10 positive integers:  
`[3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 35, 45, 90]`

### The program performs the following tasks:
1. Prints the array
2. Prints the shape and data type of the array
3. Multiplies each element in the array by 2 and prints the result

#### What I learned
- How to create a NumPy array using `np.array`
- How to check the shape of the array with `.shape`
- How to check the data type with `.dtype`
- How to apply operations to every element in the array using broadcasting (`* 2`)

##### Sample Output
